Solo, \r\n\"Identifying fMRI Model Violations with Lagrange Multiplier Tests\", \r\nIEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, in press.\r\n\r\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2012.2195327\r\n\r\nB.

The tests are implemented as objects, so the user \r\nfirst defines an anomaly test object with default properties, \r\nmodifies those properties for individual preference, then runs the \r\ntest. \r\n\r\nEach different test comprises a new test object, though the data \r\nand input stimulus signal within each test can be modified easily \r\nto facilitate batch processing using otherwise identical model \r\nassumptions.\r\n\r\nDefault test definitions take an input of form:\r\n\r\n    TEST_OBJ = SPECIFIC_TEST_OBJECT\r\n                (data, ...\r\n                 input_stim_init, ...\r\n                 TR, ...\r\n                 <LM_DG test: optional> DG_DERIV, ...\r\n                 <ALL: optional> extraDriftVars)\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n    data            = type=double  : dim (#TimePoints x #Voxels)\r\n                         -- fMRI data matrix (2D)\r\n    input_stim_init = type=logical : dim (#TimePoints x 1)\r\n                         -- input stimulus signal\r\n    TR              = type=double  : scalar\r\n                         -- Sampling repetition time (seconds)\r\n\r\nThe Double Gamma HRF test has an additional optional input to test the\r\nDouble Gamma & Temporal Derivative models from either FSL or SPM:\r\n    \r\n    DG_DERIV        = type=string  : 'SPM', 'FSL', false\r\n                         -- optional, test validity of DG+derivative model\r\n\r\nhowever for all tests only data, input_stim_init and TR are mandatory.\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nKnown issues/ improvements:\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nRequires MATLAB 2010b or newer.\r\n\r\nCurrently requires fMRI data input as a 2D matrix (time x voxels). Future versions will include support for SPM data structures and additional tools for reporting and interpreting results.  \r\n\r\nOutput anomaly test statistic is in the same shape as the input data, so will need reshaping to view the anomaly map (although the map is instructive, the presence of model anomaly anywhere within an fMRI data volume is cause for concern; see http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2012.2195327).\r\n\r\nThis version selects model orders (AR and regression) separately, as a first approximation to a cyclic descent procedure. A git development branch is available (origin/simulParaEst/) which estimates these parameters concurrently (although with added performance penalty)."}
